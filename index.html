          Alan Mathison Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English
          mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst,
          philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential
          in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a
          formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the
          Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose
          computer. Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical
          computer science and artificial intelligence. Despite these
          accomplishments, he was never fully recognised in his home country
          during his lifetime due to the prevalence of homophobia at the time
          and because much of his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
          During the Second World War, Turing worked for the Government Code and
          Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre
          that produced Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section
          that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here, he devised
          a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers,
          including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an
          electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma
          machine. Turing played a crucial role in cracking intercepted coded
          messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial
          engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in so doing
          helped win the war. Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it
          is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence had on the
          war,[14] but at the upper end it has been estimated that this work
          shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14
          million lives. After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical
          Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine. The
          Automatic Computing Engine was one of the first designs for a
          stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing
          Machine Laboratory, at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he
          helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in
          mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of
          morphogenesis and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
          Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the 1960s. Turing was
          prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts; the Labouchere Amendment of
          1885 had mandated that "gross indecency" was a criminal offence in the
          UK. He accepted chemical castration treatment, with DES, as an
          alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd
          birthday, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his death as a
          suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also
          consistent with accidental poisoning. In 2009, following an Internet
          campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public
          apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he
          was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in
          2013. The "Alan Turing law" is now an informal term for a 2017 law in
          the United Kingdom that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or
          convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.

            <p>
              Aged 14, he was sent to Sherborne School in Dorset. His first day
              of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike. Turing was so
              determined not to miss his first day of school that he cycled the
              97km from his home in Southampton. His teachers worried that he
              leaned too heavily towards maths and science, at the expense of
              the classics. The headmaster wrote to his parents: "If he is to be
              solely a scientific specialist, he is wasting his time at a public
              school".

            <p>
              At the age of 16, Turing got to grips with Albert Einstein's work
              and extrapolated Einstein's questioning of Newton's Laws of Motion
              from a text in which this was never made explicit.

              Turing's close school friend Christopher Morcom dies suddenly from
              bovine tuberculosis. Turing renounces his religious faith and
              becomes an atheist.

            <div class="linebreak"></div>
            <p>
              Turing published his paper On Computable Numbers and an
              Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (decision problem) in
              which he outlines the Universal Machine, which later became known
              as the Turing Machine. This was an idealised computing device that
              is capable of performing any mathematical computation that can be
              represented as an algorithm.

              Turing spent time at Princeton in the US studying under Alonzo
              Church. There he started to study cryptology as well as
              mathematics. In 1938 he received his PhD; his dissertation was
              called Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals and introduced original
              logic and relative computing.

              Turing proposes to his co-worker Joan Clarke, a fellow
              mathematician and cryptanalyst. Shortly after, Turing had second
              thoughts, admitting to his fiancee that he was homosexual.

            <p>
              Turing sent to the US as part of an intelligence collaboration. He
              shared what he knew about Enigma in return for being allowed to
              inspect the speech encryption system being set up to allow
              conversations between Churchill and Roosevelt. Turing was somewhat
              dismissive of US cryptanalysis, believing the Americans to rely
              too heavily on machinery instead of thought.

              Turing and colleagues manage to break the more complicated German
              Naval Enigma system. This is extremely helpful for the Allies
              during the Battle of the Atlantic as it could help them avoid the
              fearsome German U-boats, which had been responsible for sinking
              more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3 million tons of vital cargo.

            <p>
              Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory where he worked on
              developing an electronic digital stored-program computing machine
              that would later become the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine). By
              1946 he had a finished proposal for the computer, but NPL did not
              have the resources to turn it into reality.

              Turing returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. The Pilot ACE
              was built in his absence and executed its first program on 10 May
              1950.

              Turing became deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at
              Manchester University, working on software for one of the earliest
              stored program computers -- the Manchester Mark 1. He also
              explored the problem of artificial intelligence and proposed an
              experiment (in his seminal paper Computing Machinery and
              Intelligence) which became that attempted to define a standard for
              machine intelligence, which would later become known as the Turing
              test. The core idea was that a computer could be said to "think"
              if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through
              conversation, from a human being. Turing also worked with his
              former colleague D G Champernowne on a chess program for a
              computer that did not exist yet.

              Without a computer powerful enough to execute his chess program,
              Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking
              about half an hour to perform each move. The program lost to
              Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, but won against Champernowne's
              wife.

            <div class="linebreak"></div>
            <p>
              Turing meets a man called Arnold Murray and invites him over to
              his house. Murray visits Turing's house on a number of occasions,
              staying the night. Murray later helps an accomplice break into
              Turing's house. Turing reports the crime and admits having a
              sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts are illegal in
              the UK and so both were charged with gross indecency. Turing is
              given the choice of being imprisoned or chemically castrated with
              oestrogen hormone injections. He chooses the latter. Turing's
              conviction means his security clearance is removed which means he
              is barred from his cryptopgraphic consultancy for the British
              government.
